DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEMS/STATUS ON VENMO

-------------PROBLEMS---------------------
Logging into venmo through HTTPS is hard with 2 factor authentication - prevents a lot of automation approaches
- Other factors like cookies and authentication tokens can be solved through HTTP Python Library. 
- The reason why the venmo robot.txt is so empty, is because scrapping into venmo seems to be impossible/notallowed 

-----------LEADS-------------------------
RoboBrowsers (Not very promising)
More research to Python requests.Session() (works, but is stopped by 2 factor authentication) 
Selenium (Possibly?)

-----------FUTURE WORK-------------------
Research whether we can use HTTPS (Python library) through selenium
