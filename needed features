Features we need to add within our venmo webscrapper: 

Randomized user behavior (i.e, we need to click things randomly so venmo doesn't get suspicious and boot us off) (EX: clicking on a different person every 30 seconds might be PRETTY suspicious, so we need to randomize these things a bit).  

Error Handling/Possible Exceptions - we need to be able to handle errors (internet suddenly going out, being logged off/kicked off by venmo/running into a case where a user deletes their account and everyhting goes missing)

Dynamic Waits - we need to be able to make sure that everything is loaded in the page before we do ANYTHING. 
--> How can we do this? We can check for a specific web element/page that is consistent throughout the website and loads last. 
----> That way, we can wait an X amount of secs, and check if the element is loaded before doing anything (if not we just wait X seconds again)
